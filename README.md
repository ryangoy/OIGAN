# OIGAN
Object Integration Generative Adversarial Network. This is our project for CS280 at UC Berkeley. OIGAN takes in two RGBD images: one of a scene and one of an object to be inserted into the scene. OIGAN automatically crops and applies shading, occlusion, and other effects to the inserted object.
